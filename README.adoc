= Parksmap application
This application is a frontend web and gateway to backend services that provide geolocation data on services


== Backends
Backend services require to have an specific annotation to be discovered:

Discovered back-ends are listed at this endpoint:
----
curl -i /ws/backends/list
----

Note: As the application needs to interact with openshift's API, you'll need to provide some permissions to the default ServiceAccount for that.


----
type: parksmap-backend
----

Every backend should provide an endpoint located at */ws/info* that will provide link:src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/rest/gateway/model/Backend.java[Backend] information.

Here you can find 2 sample implementations:

* Springboot:

[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping("/ws/info")
@RestController
public class BackendController{

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/", produces = "application/json")
    public Backend get() {
        return new Backend(....);
    }
}
----

* JEE:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/ws/info")
public class BackendController{
    @GET
    @Path("/")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Backend get() {
        return new Backend(....);
    }
}
----
